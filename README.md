# SL_discovery_by_HITL

The website for strong lensing discovery by human-in-the-loop method. 

This website can be employed to discover strong lensing (or other rare objects) without baseline training data.  
This pipeline was successfully tested, and we are currently preparing the draft.  
Detailed information on this repo will be added when finishing the draft.
