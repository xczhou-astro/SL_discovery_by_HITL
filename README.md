# SL_discovery_by_HITL

Relevant codes for strong lensing discovery by human-in-the-loop (HITL) method.  
HITL requires interaction between human and machine, where a simple website can be employed.  

This website can be employed to discover strong gravitational lensing (or other rare objects) without baseline training data.  

The pipeline was successfully tested, and we are currently preparing the draft.  Detailed information on the method will be added when finishing the draft.
